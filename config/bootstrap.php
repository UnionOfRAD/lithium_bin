 * subclass) to be converted to another format, such as an array. The `Collection` class also allows
 * other classes to be connected as handlers to convert `Collection` objects to other formats.
 *
 * The following connects the `Media` class as a format handler, which allows `Collection`s to be
 * exported to any format with a handler provided by `Media`, i.e. JSON. This enables things like
 * the following:
 * {{{
 * $posts = Post::find('all');
 * return $posts->to('json');
